In this backend code present inside the Serverside Folder. I have created 3 path
1. localhost:8000/list - Get Page
2. localhost:8000/add - Adding data Page
3. localhost:8000/remove/{id} - Delete data page

When we run the "www" file the server starts on port 8000.
we need to visit url : localhost:8000/list/anyid to get into the get page
For addition and remove we need to fill respective data and submit the request then it weill redirect to the desired page.
